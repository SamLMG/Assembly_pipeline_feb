Here is a list of things to do for the pipeline:

- Move thread information to the config.yaml so that there is a central place where the user can change this.
- Switch remaining rules with conda environments to singularity containers. They should already be available on github.com/reslp/dockerfiles
- Write comprehensive README file with Installation steps, usage examples, list of used software + version and links.
- Add option to also provide read files locally. This is likely a bigger change.
- Test pipeline on VSC4 and adjust cluster config file so that everything works.
- Fix MITOS: This includes adding an option for genetic code (flag -c, which can be set in the config.yaml) as well as check what additional files are needed for the reference database (right now an auxilliary info file is missing)
